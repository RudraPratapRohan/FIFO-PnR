# FIFO-PnR
FIFO Controller Physical Design using Cadence Innovus

This project implements the physical design (Place and Route) of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory controller using Cadence Innovus. A FIFO is a type of memory buffer where data is read in the same order it was written, making it essential for managing data flow between different clock domains or asynchronous systems. The PnR flow in this project includes stages like floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), routing, and timing optimization to achieve efficient design closure in terms of performance, area, and power.

This repository provides all the scripts, configurations, and reports used in the complete physical design flow.
